								<h4><b>GlacierHub</b>: New Laser Technology Reveals Climate Change will Induce a Future of Stronger Saharan Dust Storms</h4>
									<blockquote>
										"Lead author Heather Clifford explained that the Saharan dust record held inside the Colle Gnifetti ice core revealed that increased dust transport historically occurs when the atmosphere creates high pressure systems over the Mediterranean and drier conditions over North Africa. Climate change models indicate that these conditions will become more vigorous, indicating a dustier future."

								<h4><b>TheGuardian</b>: Pollutionwatch: how much Sahara desert dust do we breathe?</h4>
									<blockquote>
										"Saharan dust can have a major effect on weather systems, suppressing hurricane formation and, by darkening snow, bringing forward spring thaws in the Alps. It is unclear if events will increase in the future. A dryer climate in north Africa may lead to more airborne dust but changes in weather patterns may reduce its spread. However, alpine ice cores covering the past two millennia suggests that Saharan dust has increased in the past 100 years. Also notable in the ice core record are the Saharan dust events between 1315 and 1365, a time that includes the Great Famine, when about 10% of Europe’s population perished, and the Black Death. This has led to speculation that poor air quality from Saharan dust may have contributed to a decline in human health and made the population more vulnerable."

								<h4><b>Newsweek</b>:'Godzilla' Sahara Dust Cloud Update: Second Wave Set to Reach Gulf Coast</h4>
									<blockquote>
										"Recent studies looking at the links between climate change and the transport have produced mixed results, so it is currently not clear whether the recent unusual plume is a "meteorological anomaly," or if such events could become more common as the world warms, Prospero said.
										Nevertheless, one study published in the journal JGR: Atmospheres indicated that periods of drought in North Africa, which may occur more frequently in future, could be linked to more intense dust plumes."

								<h4><b>SandwichEnterprise</b>: Sandwich High School Grad Spends Spring On Mt. Everest Studying Climate Change</h4>
									<blockquote>
										"“My role as a member of the glaciology team was to collect ice, snow, and stream samples to better understand climate, pollution, and atmospheric circulation during the past and present in the Khumbu region,” she said. Ms. Clifford was involved with drilling ice core samples from the Khumbu Glacier, which is next to the Everest Base Camp. The samples were collected over a month-long period."

										"From April to June 2019, an international team of scientists, climbers and storytellers, led by the National Geographic Society and Tribhuvan University and supported in partnership with Rolex, conducted a scientific expedition to Mount Everest. Among this crew were team members Heather Clifford and Laura Mattas who, on their university’s commencement day, celebrated the completion of their degrees with a once-in-a-lifetime graduation ceremony at base camp!"
