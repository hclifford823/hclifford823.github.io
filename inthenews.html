									<h4><b>GlacierHub</b>: New Laser Technology Reveals Climate Change will Induce a Future of Stronger Saharan Dust Storms</h4>
									<a href="https://glacierhub.org/2020/02/25/new-laser-technology-reveals-climate-change-will-bring-a-future-of-stronger-saharan-dust-storms/">link to article.</a>
									<blockquote>
										"Lead author Heather Clifford explained that the Saharan dust record held inside the Colle Gnifetti
										ice core revealed that increased dust transport historically occurs when the atmosphere creates high
										pressure systems over the Mediterranean and drier conditions over North Africa. Climate change models
										indicate that these conditions will become more vigorous, indicating a dustier future."

									<h4><b>The Guardian</b>: Pollution Watch: how much Sahara desert dust do we breathe?</h4>
									<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/12/pollutionwatch-how-much-sahara-desert-dust-do-we-breathe">link to article.</a>
									<blockquote>
										"Saharan dust can have a major effect on weather systems, suppressing hurricane formation and,
										by darkening snow, bringing forward spring thaws in the Alps. It is unclear if events will increase
										in the future. A dryer climate in north Africa may lead to more airborne dust but changes in weather patterns
										may reduce its spread. However, alpine ice cores covering the past two millennia suggests that Saharan dust
										has increased in the past 100 years. Also notable in the ice core record are the Saharan dust events between
										1315 and 1365, a time that includes the Great Famine, when about 10% of Europe’s population perished, and the
										Black Death. This has led to speculation that poor air quality from Saharan dust may have contributed to a decline
										in human health and made the population more vulnerable."

									<blockquote>
										"Recent studies looking at the links between climate change and the transport have produced mixed results,
										so it is currently not clear whether the recent unusual plume is a "meteorological anomaly," or if such events
										could become more common as the world warms, Prospero said.Nevertheless, one study published in the journal
										JGR: Atmospheres indicated that periods of drought in North Africa, which may occur more frequently in future,
										could be linked to more intense dust plumes."

									<blockquote>
										“It was probably my favorite part,” Clifford said of walking around the edges of the icefall taking ice core samples.
										Glacial peaks, known as penitents, towered 20 feet overhead. Created when the snow goes straight from solid to gas,
										vaporizing in low humidity and a dew point below freezing, these fields of pinnacles are named for their resemblance
										to the pointed white hoods worn by Spanish religious orders during Holy Week. “If you are walking through it, it’s
										as though you are in an ice forest,” said Clifford, who was not part of the climbing expedition."

										"“My role as a member of the glaciology team was to collect ice, snow, and stream samples to better understand
										climate, pollution, and atmospheric circulation during the past and present in the Khumbu region,” she said.
										Ms. Clifford was involved with drilling ice core samples from the Khumbu Glacier, which is next to the Everest Base Camp.
										The samples were collected over a month-long period."

										"From April to June 2019, an international team of scientists, climbers and storytellers, led by the
										National Geographic Society and Tribhuvan University and supported in partnership with Rolex, conducted a scientific
										expedition to Mount Everest. Among this crew were team members Heather Clifford and Laura Mattas who, on their university’s
										commencement day, celebrated the completion of their degrees with a once-in-a-lifetime graduation ceremony at base camp!"

										future hikers, and residents for hundreds of years to come. The culprit was their gear."

 									<blockquote>
										"Mayewski and his interdisciplinary team decided to look for the same eruptions in an ice core
										drilled in 2013 in the Colle Gnifetti Glacier in the Swiss Alps. The 72-meter-long core entombs
										more than 2000 years of fallout from volcanoes, Saharan dust storms, and human activities smack
										in the center of Europe. The team deciphered this record using a new ultra–high-resolution method,
										in which a laser carves 120-micron slivers of ice, representing just a few days or weeks of snowfall, along the length of the core."
